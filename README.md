# Comparison of ARIMA and LSTM for time series forecasting

The goal is to compare performance of traditional ARIMA models and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) for time series forecasting. 

This comparison is not straightforward due to the different nature of the methods and different possible formulations of the time series forecasting problem. We look at several of the most commonly used formulations.  

We perform the comparison on two datasets:

1. **Electricity consumption** (trend and seasonality)

2. **Air pollution** (no clear trend or seasonality)
